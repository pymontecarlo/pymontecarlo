**pyMonteCarlo** is a programming interface to run identical simulations using
different Monte Carlo programs. The interface was designed to have common input
and output that are independent of any Monte Carlo code. This allows users to
combine the advantages of different codes and to compare the effect of different
physical models without manually creating and running new simulations for each
Monte Carlo program. The analysis of the results is also simplified by the
common output format where results are expressed in the same units.

**pyMonteCarlo** is currently under development.
